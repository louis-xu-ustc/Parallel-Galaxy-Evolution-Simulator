    <h4> Make sure your project schedule on your main project page is up to date with work completed so far, and well as
        with a revised plan of work for the coming weeks. As by this time you should have a good understanding of what
        is required to complete your project, I want to see a very detailed schedule for the coming weeks. I suggest
        breaking time down into half-week increments. Each increment should have at least one task, and for each task
        put a person's name on it.

        Describe how you are doing with respect to the goals and deliverables stated in your proposal. Do you still
        believe you will be able to produce all your deliverables? If not, why? What about the "nice to haves"? In your
        checkpoint writeup we want a new list of goals that you plan to hit for the Parallelism competition.

    <h4>
        What do you plan to show at the parallelism competition? Will it be a demo? Will it be a graph?

    <ul>
        <p>
            we plan to show a video that records the beautiful pattern of the galaxy evolution simulator
            and several graphs that compare the performance of different algorithms. Currently, we intend to include
            sequential BarnesHut, sequential MortonCode, parallel BarnesHut and parallel MortonCode. If time permits,
            we also wants to try Fast Multipole Method (FMM) mentioned in the proposal.

    <h4>
        Do you have preliminary results at this time? If so, it would be great to included them in your checkpoint
        write-up.

        <p>
            <strong>Figure 3</strong> is a screen shot that depicts the current performance comparison result. As you
            can see, we have finished three versions of galaxy simulator - seqBarnes, seqMorton and cudaBarnes.
            We do some simple statistic analysis about the result, including total time consumption to generate the
            pattern in 1000 loops, and the average time consumption for a single loop. It's clear that both the total
            time
            and average time consumption decrease sharply from seqBarnes to cudaBarnes.

    <h4>
        List the issues that concern you the most. Are there any remaining unknowns (things you simply don't know how to
        solve, or resource you don't know how to get) or is it just a matter of coding and doing the work? If you do not
        wish to put this information on a public web site you are welcome to email the staff directly.
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            the first concern is that we need to figure out a better method to evaluate the performance of different
            algorithms, since different algorithms use different strategies to grouping particles. We cannot directly
            say one algorithm is better than the other one, even between sequential and parallel versions. One
            method may have an approximation ratio (let's say 5%) to the result of sequential BarnusHut version for
            every
            frame.
        </li>
        <li>
            according to our original plan, the second algorithm to implement is Fast Multipole Method (FMM), but later
            during in the reference survey, we find a algorithm that uses Morton Code to approximately group particles
            and also supports parallel constructing the tree which is the bottleneck of the previous sequential
            Barneshut version. Currently, we delay the implementation of FMM algorithm and will do the parallel
            version for this new Morton code based method first. So, FMM becomes one of the remaining unknowns. We may
            put this feature into "nice to have" list.
